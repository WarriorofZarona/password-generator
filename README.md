Homework Assignment #3

I have to create an application that generates a random password to the user using different characters, upper and lower case, numeric, as well as special characters, based on the user criteria.

When a user clicks the button, a series of prompts will show on the user screen, helping to determine the type and length of password, and when finished, the randomly generated password will appear on screen.
