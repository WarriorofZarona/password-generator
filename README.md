Homework Assignment #3

I have to create an application that generates a random password to the user using different characters, 

When a user clicks the button, a series of prompts will show on the user screen, helping to determine the length of password, followed by confirming upper case, lower case, numeric, and special characters, and when finished, the randomly generated password will appear on screen based on the criteria.
